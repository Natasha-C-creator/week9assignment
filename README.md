## üéØ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

-- The syntax
-- Knowing which guides on the internet are actually credible or not
-- Running out of time.

----What went really well and what could have gone better?
I am pleased with the nav bar, images on the home screen, and the fact that the links work!

I totally ran out of steam to fix the issue with comments not displaying on the page once saved. They comments do save to the database, however. 

Some of the styling on the pages is very poor and not how I'd want it to go to production!

I didn't attempt the delete part.

Overall, for an absolute beginner who had never coded until a few weeks ago, I'm pleased with this simple website. I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm never going to be a software developer! I totally understand the concepts and can describe what needs to happen in standard English language, but I'm struggling with translating that into coding language - the syntax is not coming to me easily. I also realise my skills are more in the project and product management side of things; I find the planning bit to be second nature.
