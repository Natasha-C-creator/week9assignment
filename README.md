SUPABASE SCHEMA:

## ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you/did not achieve?

- COMPLETE As a user, I want to sign up and log in securely using Clerk so that I can interact with the app as a user on the site
- ....and edit my user profile.
- COMPLETE As a user, I want to see an error/not found page (using error.js or not-found.js) if I try to visit a page on the site which doesnâ€™t exist.
- COMPLETE As a user, I want an enhanced user experience with modern UI components, such as using a Radix UI Primitive or a similar library, so that the interface is more intuitive and visually appealing.
- INCOMPLETE As a user, I want to create and manage my profile, including adding information like a biography, so that I can personalise my account.
- INCOMPLETE As a user, I want to create my posts to be displayed on my profile page so that I can share and manage my content easily.

## ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

----What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

----What went really well and what could have gone better?

- I changed tack for this week's assignment! This week, instead of thinking I needed to fly solo and figure it all out by myself, I've worked out that I could follow along to all of the recordings and the moodle docs to piece everything together. It's only taken me 9 weeks...!
- I spent more time on functionality than on styling this week.
-

What could have gone better:
-- Since Week 8 and we started on Next.js, everything just runs really, really slowly. I suspect it's my set up, but it's painful watching something take over 20 seconds to load each time I want to refresh to check if something's worked.

--Git branches. We're not friends. I totally get the concept and know the reasons for it, but on the occasions when I forget to immediately merge a branch on GitHub, it punishes me so much! I get so many errors but end up debugging that for aaaaaaaaaaaaaages. So I just stick with adding to the main branch, despite knowing it's not best practice...
